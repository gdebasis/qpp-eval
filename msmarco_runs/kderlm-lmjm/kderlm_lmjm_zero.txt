In prokaryotes, which do not have a membrane-bound nucleus, the DNA is found as a single circular chromosome in the cytoplasm. Some prokaryotes, such as bacteria, and a few eukaryotes have extrachromosomal DNA known as plasmids, which are autonomous, self-replicating genetic material.
2625	Q0	2042346	4	30.395819	bm	Extrachromosomal DNA is any DNA that is found outside the nucleus of a cell. It is also referred to as extranuclear DNA or cytoplasmic DNA. Most DNA in an individual genome is found in chromosomes but DNA found outside the nucleus also serves important biological functions.

Rejection comes in several forms: Hyperacute rejection Ã¢Â€Â“ Because of crossmatching prior to the transplant, this is a very rare form of rejection. It is when the body immediately destroys the transplanted kidney. Acute rejection Ã¢Â€Â“ Usually occurrs in the first few months after transplant, but it can happen at any time after the transplant.
