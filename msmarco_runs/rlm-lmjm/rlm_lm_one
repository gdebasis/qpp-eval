5729	Q0	2695110	10	10.65448	bm	Note, that this equation yields wine alcohol content as a percentage of alcohol by volume. There are other equations for alcohol by weight, however, wine alcohol content by volume is the most prevalent way to report alcohol levels.
5095	Q0	1510719	1	25.291155	bm	Most of the calories in beer are from the alcohol itself and if you look at the alcohol content in the MGD 64 you will understand why it has so few calories, its only 2.8% alc/vol. Miller lite, Michelob Ultra, Bud Light, and Coors Light are almost as light as it gets, I think with Mich Ultra at the fewest with only 95.
5095	Q0	6984774	2	25.15712	bm	Budweiser rates at 145 calories with a 5% alcohol content. MGD 64 rates at 64 calories with a 2.8% alcohol content. Only in America will consumers once again fall for this marketing ploy, first started by Miller with Ã¢Â€Â˜LiteÃ¢Â€Â™ beer. Buy what you like to taste.

5095	Q0	6984777	5	22.342113	bm	UPDATE: In response to reader questions, Miller 64 is 2.8 percent alcohol by volume, according to a spokesman for Miller Brewing Company.
5095	Q0	2655524	6	21.763817	bm	What is the alcohol content of Miller Lite? The alcohol content of a 12-ounce serving of Miller Lite beer is 4.2 percent by volume. There are 96 calories in Miller Lite. Other Miller brand beers have alcohol contents in the range between 4.2 and 5.5 percent.
5095	Q0	1673242	7	20.366495	bm	Miller Lite (96 cal, 4.2% alcohol, 190.5 cal/alcohol oz) - This has the exact same calories-per-ounce of alcohol breakdown as MGD 64, so we used carbs as a tiebreaker and it loses, with 3.2 to MGD 64's 2.4. But hey, it destroyed Bud Light and Coors Light, neither of which even cracked this top 11.
5095	Q0	6540465	8	20.112217	bm	Because a lot of your brewÃ¢Â€Â™s calories come from its alcohol content, explains Michael Kiser, craft-beer writer and enthusiast, and owner of ChicagoÃ¢Â€Â™s Good Beer Hunting. So yeah, when you drink a Miller 64 youÃ¢Â€Â™re swallowing fewer calories per bottle. But considering you need to slam at least two bottles to match the mellow buzz youÃ¢Â€Â™d get from a single IPA, chances are good youÃ¢Â€Â™ll end up downing the same number of calories by nightÃ¢Â€Â™s end.

5095	Q0	1510723	10	19.63679	bm	from the top of my head I would say MGD 64 if your asking per 12 fl oz. Most of the calories in beer are from the alcohol itself and if you look at the alcohol content in the MGD 64 you will understand why it has so few calories, its only 2.8% alc/vol.

341902	Q0	8394778	4	32.64587	bm	Island arcs are formed by the subduction of an oceanic plate beneath another oceanic plate. The oceanic plate that is subducted beneath the other plate melts as it is pushed dÃ¢Â€Â¦own into the mantle and creates a source of magma. The magma rises and forms volcanoes which create the islands of the island arc. The Hawaiian islands are formed by a mantle plume which is roughly in the center of the Pacific plate. The plate is moving across the plume and the islands are being formed in a line as the plate moves.
341902	Q0	7582638	5	32.28572	bm	The temperature of the plume causes the crust to melt and form pipes, which can vent magma. Because the tectonic plates move whereas the mantle plume remains in the same place, each volcano becomes dormant after a while and a new volcano is then formed as the plate shifts over the hotspot. The Hawaiian Islands are thought to be formed in such a manner, as well as the Snake River Plain, with the Yellowstone Caldera being the part of the North American plate currently above the hotspot.
341902	Q0	6650019	6	31.994793	bm	The original ideaIn 1963 Wilson suggested that the Hawaiian Islands formed as the Pacific plate moved over continuously upwelling hot mantle.

The classic Plate Tectonics story for Hawaii now appears to be mistaken. The Pacific plate did not suddenly change directions, and there is no deep, stationary plume. Other explanations fit the evidence better.

341902	Q0	6685228	9	29.731844	bm	Whilst most volcanic activity happens at plate margins, there are cases of volcanoes erupting in the middle of plates. The Hawaiian Islands are formed by volcanic activity, despite the nearest plate margin being 3,200 km away. Some geologists have suggested that a 'hot spot' in the mantle, which remains stationary as the Pacific Plate moves over it, explains the existence of the island chain. The hot spot may represent the top of a mantle plume which originated deep down at the outer core - lower mantle boundary.

11910	Q0	7140439	2	21.68874	bm	He would borrow a wrench so he could retard the timing and stop the pinging that happened every time he stepped on the gas pedal to pass a car or go up a hill. He had done work on the car and reinstalled the distributor without adjusting the timing. There was some laziness involved or he didn't have his timing light at home. His engine was running hot and that was causing the pinging. Retarding the timing will cause the engine to cool down a bit and stop the pinging. If the timing is too far advanced, the spark itself can cause the pinging. If the engine is too hot or the fuel has too low of an octane rating, pre-ignition can cause the pinging. If there is carbon buildup anywhere in the combustion chamber, the rough ends of the carbon will get red hot and cause the pinging.

He had done work on the car and reinstalled the distributor without adjusting the timing. There was some laziness involved or he didn't have his timing light at home. His engine was running hot and that was causing the pinging. Retarding the timing will cause the engine to cool down a bit and stop the pinging. If the timing is too far advanced, the spark itself can cause the pinging. If the engine is too hot or the fuel has too low of an octane rating, pre-ignition can cause the pinging. If there is carbon buildup anywhere in the combustion chamber, the rough ends of the carbon will get red hot and cause the pinging.

379271	Q0	6894844	1	24.218729	bm	by Michael Shiffer. There has been a lot of mail concerning how to set timing with an unknown engine. I think a basic description of timing might help sort out a lot of this. First, you should know that there are two types of timing in an engine: cam timing and ignition timing.
379271	Q0	3681601	2	23.979183	bm	Ignition timing ONLY has to do with when the spark plug lights. The distributor may be driven by the cam gear BUT, the distributor rotates freely and can be rotated in any position to set the timing wherever you want, regardless of whether the cam is advanced, retarded or straight-up.
379271	Q0	6894848	3	23.42261	bm	So, since the cam manufacturers generally provide you with a recommended ignition timing expressed in degrees before top dead center (BTDC) of the compression stroke, it is going to be best to set your timing using a degree wheel. (This is a good time to degree your cam too) On to the dreaded degree wheelÃ¢Â€Â¦.
379271	Q0	6894846	4	23.403366	bm	So, since the cam manufacturers generally provide you with a recommended ignition timing expressed in degrees before top dead center (BTDC) of the compression stroke, it is going to be best to set your timing using a degree wheel.
379271	Q0	2251703	5	22.934721	bm	16.) Over advanced ignition timing can cause the engine to not idle and stall on cold starts. Check the timing with the SPOUT out and it should be in the range of 8-14 degrees BTC. Be sure to put the SPOUT back in when you finish.ow your mechanical and electronic problems are fixed, you can set the base idle speed. Setting the base idle speed: First of all, the idle needs to be adjusted to where the speed is at or below 600 RPM with the IAC disconnected. If you have a wild cam, you may have to raise this figure 100-150 RPM or so.
379271	Q0	5442103	6	22.878864	bm	2. Moving the cam sensor a few degrees does nothing to the ignition timing. If the car runs, (and the 3x trigger on the balancer is mounted correctly by the factory) then your ignition timing will be EXACTLY what's in the spark map of the chip regardless of where the cam sensor is set.3.oving the cam sensor a few degrees does nothing to the ignition timing. If the car runs, (and the 3x trigger on the balancer is mounted correctly by the factory) then your ignition timing will be EXACTLY what's in the spark map of the chip regardless of where the cam sensor is set.
379271	Q0	6894849	7	21.18287	bm	Just because they share the same word of timing doesn't mean they are referring to the same MEANING of what timing is. For some reason a lot of guys think that if their cam is advanced (or retarded) a few degrees that it affects their ignition timing.
379271	Q0	6894851	8	21.117416	bm	Contrary to what a lot of people think, cam timing and ignition timing have nothing to do with each other, anymore than a timing belt and a fan belt have anything to do with each other.
379271	Q0	3681597	9	20.47166	bm	Contrary to what a lot of people think, cam timing and ignition timing have nothing to do with each other, anymore than a timing belt and a fan belt have anything to do with each other. They just happen to share a common word of timing but that word is in a completely different context from each other.

Once you have the timing set and are done with any track adjustments, measure the distance from the deck to the top of the piston (with the white timing lines aligned) and record the measurement.

23260	Q0	8361231	4	16.392696	bm	One guilty pleasure of owning a kitten is rubbing that heart-meltingly soft fur against your cheek. Your kitten most likely isn't complaining and probably enjoys the snuggle, too. Enjoy his soft, fuzzy coat while you can, because soon he'll shed his baby coat for the coarser hair of adulthood. With maturity comes many changes, and for your kitten one of those changes is his coat. Kittens are born with a soft, cottony-like coat to keep them warm and melt human hearts. Starting at around 5 months of age, your kitten may start shedding this soft fur for the thicker, tougher coat he'll carry as an adult. It usually takes about a month or so to make the change, during which time you'll find his baby fur coating your couch, bed and clothes.

Your kitten most likely isn't complaining and probably enjoys the snuggle, too. Enjoy his soft, fuzzy coat while you can, because soon he'll shed his baby coat for the coarser hair of adulthood. With maturity comes many changes, and for your kitten one of those changes is his coat. Kittens are born with a soft, cottony-like coat to keep them warm and melt human hearts. Starting at around 5 months of age, your kitten may start shedding this soft fur for the thicker, tougher coat he'll carry as an adult. It usually takes about a month or so to make the change, during which time you'll find his baby fur coating your couch, bed and clothes.
