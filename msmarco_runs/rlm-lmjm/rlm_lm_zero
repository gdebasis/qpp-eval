Rejection comes in several forms: Hyperacute rejection Ã¢Â€Â“ Because of crossmatching prior to the transplant, this is a very rare form of rejection. It is when the body immediately destroys the transplanted kidney. Acute rejection Ã¢Â€Â“ Usually occurrs in the first few months after transplant, but it can happen at any time after the transplant.
