341902	Q0	8394778	2	43.488396	bm	Island arcs are formed by the subduction of an oceanic plate beneath another oceanic plate. The oceanic plate that is subducted beneath the other plate melts as it is pushed dÃ¢Â€Â¦own into the mantle and creates a source of magma. The magma rises and forms volcanoes which create the islands of the island arc. The Hawaiian islands are formed by a mantle plume which is roughly in the center of the Pacific plate. The plate is moving across the plume and the islands are being formed in a line as the plate moves.

341902	Q0	7582638	5	41.19232	bm	The temperature of the plume causes the crust to melt and form pipes, which can vent magma. Because the tectonic plates move whereas the mantle plume remains in the same place, each volcano becomes dormant after a while and a new volcano is then formed as the plate shifts over the hotspot. The Hawaiian Islands are thought to be formed in such a manner, as well as the Snake River Plain, with the Yellowstone Caldera being the part of the North American plate currently above the hotspot.

Plate divergence is taking place in the Pacific Ocean. 3. A mantle plume that starts beneath the ocean results in what? Answer a large plateau of flood basalt on the seafloor a divergent plate boundary the development of an oceanic trench a volcanic island arc 4. How do changing ocean basins alter global climate?

The Hawaiian Islands are formed by volcanic activity, despite the nearest plate margin being 3,200 km away. Some geologists have suggested that a 'hot spot' in the mantle, which remains stationary as the Pacific Plate moves over it, explains the existence of the island chain. The hot spot may represent the top of a mantle plume which originated deep down at the outer core - lower mantle boundary.

Pinging occurs when an engine's combustion gases are ignited at the wrong times. bad oxygen sensor can impede the air/fuel mixture of an engine or interfere with the engine combustion, both of which can cause an engine to miss, or run irregularly.
11910	Q0	7140439	2	29.178886	bm	He would borrow a wrench so he could retard the timing and stop the pinging that happened every time he stepped on the gas pedal to pass a car or go up a hill. He had done work on the car and reinstalled the distributor without adjusting the timing. There was some laziness involved or he didn't have his timing light at home. His engine was running hot and that was causing the pinging. Retarding the timing will cause the engine to cool down a bit and stop the pinging. If the timing is too far advanced, the spark itself can cause the pinging. If the engine is too hot or the fuel has too low of an octane rating, pre-ignition can cause the pinging. If there is carbon buildup anywhere in the combustion chamber, the rough ends of the carbon will get red hot and cause the pinging.

379271	Q0	6894844	4	29.429075	bm	by Michael Shiffer. There has been a lot of mail concerning how to set timing with an unknown engine.

Check the timing with the SPOUT out and it should be in the range of 8-14 degrees BTC. Be sure to put the SPOUT back in when you finish.ow your mechanical and electronic problems are fixed, you can set the base idle speed. Setting the base idle speed: First of all, the idle needs to be adjusted to where the speed is at or below 600 RPM with the IAC disconnected. If you have a wild cam, you may have to raise this figure 100-150 RPM or so.

379271	Q0	6894851	9	25.398945	bm	Contrary to what a lot of people think, cam timing and ignition timing have nothing to do with each other, anymore than a timing belt and a fan belt have anything to do with each other.
379271	Q0	5446670	10	25.289722	bm	In order to set an initial timing advance or timing retard for an engine, the engine is allowed to idle and the distributor is adjusted to achieve the best ignition timing for the engine at idle speed. This process is called 'setting the base advance'.

In rare occasions, a cat will have an estrus cycle within a week after her kittens were born.
