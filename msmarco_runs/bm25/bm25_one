341902	Q0	8394778	2	42.933773	bm	Island arcs are formed by the subduction of an oceanic plate beneath another oceanic plate. The oceanic plate that is subducted beneath the other plate melts as it is pushed dÃ¢Â€Â¦own into the mantle and creates a source of magma. The magma rises and forms volcanoes which create the islands of the island arc. The Hawaiian islands are formed by a mantle plume which is roughly in the center of the Pacific plate. The plate is moving across the plume and the islands are being formed in a line as the plate moves.

A mantle plume and hotspot is instead responsible for the formation and volcanism that created Diamond Head.
341902	Q0	7582638	5	40.64283	bm	The temperature of the plume causes the crust to melt and form pipes, which can vent magma. Because the tectonic plates move whereas the mantle plume remains in the same place, each volcano becomes dormant after a while and a new volcano is then formed as the plate shifts over the hotspot. The Hawaiian Islands are thought to be formed in such a manner, as well as the Snake River Plain, with the Yellowstone Caldera being the part of the North American plate currently above the hotspot.

The Hawaiian Islands are evidence of what? Answer The crust there has progressively moved over a hotspot. Plate convergence is taking place in the Pacific Ocean. Mantle plumes can move over time. Plate divergence is taking place in the Pacific Ocean. 3. A mantle plume that starts beneath the ocean results in what? Answer a large plateau of flood basalt on the seafloor a divergent plate boundary the development of an oceanic trench a volcanic island arc 4. How do changing ocean basins alter global climate? Answer They have changed global wind patterns. They have altered EarthÃ¢Â€Â™s rotation. They have changed ocean currents.

341902	Q0	84129	8	38.225094	bm	The mixture of molten rock, crystals and dissolved gases from the mantle is called magma. When magma erupts to the Earth's surface, it is called lava. Not all volcanic eruptions happen near the boundaries of tectonic plates. Some eruptions happen in the middle of the plates.These eruptions are caused by mantle streams called plumes. Mantle plumes are formed when hot magma rises beneath the thinner, or weaker, areas of the Earth's crust, creating 'hot spots'.

341902	Q0	6685228	9	36.998756	bm	Whilst most volcanic activity happens at plate margins, there are cases of volcanoes erupting in the middle of plates. The Hawaiian Islands are formed by volcanic activity, despite the nearest plate margin being 3,200 km away. Some geologists have suggested that a 'hot spot' in the mantle, which remains stationary as the Pacific Plate moves over it, explains the existence of the island chain. The hot spot may represent the top of a mantle plume which originated deep down at the outer core - lower mantle boundary.

Ã¢Â€ÂœLucilleÃ¢Â€Â� is a song written by Roger Bowling and Hal Bynum, and recorded by American country music artist Kenny Rogers. It was released in January 1977 as the second and final single from the album Kenny Rogers. The song is about a man in a bar who meets a woman who has left her husband.
11910	Q0	7140439	1	28.8028	bm	He would borrow a wrench so he could retard the timing and stop the pinging that happened every time he stepped on the gas pedal to pass a car or go up a hill. He had done work on the car and reinstalled the distributor without adjusting the timing. There was some laziness involved or he didn't have his timing light at home. His engine was running hot and that was causing the pinging. Retarding the timing will cause the engine to cool down a bit and stop the pinging. If the timing is too far advanced, the spark itself can cause the pinging. If the engine is too hot or the fuel has too low of an octane rating, pre-ignition can cause the pinging. If there is carbon buildup anywhere in the combustion chamber, the rough ends of the carbon will get red hot and cause the pinging.
11910	Q0	30190	2	28.663956	bm	If a bad oxygen sensor is aligned with the ignition system on a car's engine, it can retard or advance engine ignition timing, which can cause an engine to ping. Pinging occurs when an engine's combustion gases are ignited at the wrong times. bad oxygen sensor can impede the air/fuel mixture of an engine or interfere with the engine combustion, both of which can cause an engine to miss, or run irregularly.

Oxygen sensors can control or contribute to many different engine functions, including fuel/air mixture, engine timing and engine combustion intervals.
11910	Q0	3743678	5	27.491814	bm	This is often the case on higher mileage engines. If you have to advance the ignition timing a lot to make an engine run, it probably has a bad timing chain and bad VALVE timing. Newer vehicles have their ignition and fuel controlled partly or entirely by the vehicle computer. mark is placed somewhere on the crankshaft to indicate this position and labeled ZERO DEGREES OR TDC. This mark is used to set the ignition timing. The spark advance varies as to engine speed, but it is set to an initial base setting, called BASE TIMING.

11910	Q0	3743679	9	27.025976	bm	If the spark occurs too late, the maximum cylinder pressure will occur too late, thus not converting the gasoline energy into power, but wasting it as heat that the cooling system must get rid of. If the ignition timing is incorrect, not only will the engine run too hot but it won t have the power it should.An incorrect air/fuel mixture can also cause an overheating problem; a lean air/fuel mixture will cause an engine to create more heat than a rich air/fuel mixture. distributor test stand is much easier because you can run the distributor at 6000 engine rpm or more without the fear of hurting an engine.

379270	Q0	3256146	10	21.625982	bm	What is an ignition interlock? An ignition interlock is a device that measures the alcohol in your breath and allows you to start your vehicle if it is below the set point. The device also requires periodic retests while the vehicle is running. The interlock records a number of items including test results, engine starts and vehicle run times.
11910	Q0	7140439	1	28.8028	bm	He would borrow a wrench so he could retard the timing and stop the pinging that happened every time he stepped on the gas pedal to pass a car or go up a hill. He had done work on the car and reinstalled the distributor without adjusting the timing. There was some laziness involved or he didn't have his timing light at home. His engine was running hot and that was causing the pinging. Retarding the timing will cause the engine to cool down a bit and stop the pinging. If the timing is too far advanced, the spark itself can cause the pinging. If the engine is too hot or the fuel has too low of an octane rating, pre-ignition can cause the pinging. If there is carbon buildup anywhere in the combustion chamber, the rough ends of the carbon will get red hot and cause the pinging.
11910	Q0	30190	2	28.663956	bm	If a bad oxygen sensor is aligned with the ignition system on a car's engine, it can retard or advance engine ignition timing, which can cause an engine to ping.

11910	Q0	3743678	5	27.491814	bm	This is often the case on higher mileage engines. If you have to advance the ignition timing a lot to make an engine run, it probably has a bad timing chain and bad VALVE timing. Newer vehicles have their ignition and fuel controlled partly or entirely by the vehicle computer. mark is placed somewhere on the crankshaft to indicate this position and labeled ZERO DEGREES OR TDC. This mark is used to set the ignition timing. The spark advance varies as to engine speed, but it is set to an initial base setting, called BASE TIMING.

11910	Q0	3743679	9	27.025976	bm	If the spark occurs too late, the maximum cylinder pressure will occur too late, thus not converting the gasoline energy into power, but wasting it as heat that the cooling system must get rid of. If the ignition timing is incorrect, not only will the engine run too hot but it won t have the power it should.An incorrect air/fuel mixture can also cause an overheating problem; a lean air/fuel mixture will cause an engine to create more heat than a rich air/fuel mixture. distributor test stand is much easier because you can run the distributor at 6000 engine rpm or more without the fear of hurting an engine. In many cases a distributor may still be advancing the timing well above 6000 RPM; therefore the advance curve must be checked at all the rpm ranges the engine will be used in!

The distributor may be driven by the cam gear BUT, the distributor rotates freely and can be rotated in any position to set the timing wherever you want, regardless of whether the cam is advanced, retarded or straight-up.
379271	Q0	6894848	3	29.558552	bm	So, since the cam manufacturers generally provide you with a recommended ignition timing expressed in degrees before top dead center (BTDC) of the compression stroke, it is going to be best to set your timing using a degree wheel. (This is a good time to degree your cam too) On to the dreaded degree wheelÃ¢Â€Â¦.
379271	Q0	6894844	4	28.667719	bm	by Michael Shiffer. There has been a lot of mail concerning how to set timing with an unknown engine. I think a basic description of timing might help sort out a lot of this. First, you should know that there are two types of timing in an engine: cam timing and ignition timing.
379271	Q0	6894846	5	27.961218	bm	So, since the cam manufacturers generally provide you with a recommended ignition timing expressed in degrees before top dead center (BTDC) of the compression stroke, it is going to be best to set your timing using a degree wheel.
379271	Q0	2251703	6	27.777035	bm	16.) Over advanced ignition timing can cause the engine to not idle and stall on cold starts. Check the timing with the SPOUT out and it should be in the range of 8-14 degrees BTC. Be sure to put the SPOUT back in when you finish.ow your mechanical and electronic problems are fixed, you can set the base idle speed. Setting the base idle speed: First of all, the idle needs to be adjusted to where the speed is at or below 600 RPM with the IAC disconnected. If you have a wild cam, you may have to raise this figure 100-150 RPM or so.
379271	Q0	5446670	7	24.969212	bm	In order to set an initial timing advance or timing retard for an engine, the engine is allowed to idle and the distributor is adjusted to achieve the best ignition timing for the engine at idle speed. This process is called 'setting the base advance'.
379271	Q0	6894845	8	24.65765	bm	(This is a good time to degree your cam too) On to the dreaded degree wheelÃ¢Â€Â¦. ThatÃ¢Â€Â™s it! Once you have the timing set and are done with any track adjustments, measure the distance from the deck to the top of the piston (with the white timing lines aligned) and record the measurement.
379271	Q0	6894849	9	24.607864	bm	Just because they share the same word of timing doesn't mean they are referring to the same MEANING of what timing is. For some reason a lot of guys think that if their cam is advanced (or retarded) a few degrees that it affects their ignition timing.
379271	Q0	6894851	10	24.607864	bm	Contrary to what a lot of people think, cam timing and ignition timing have nothing to do with each other, anymore than a timing belt and a fan belt have anything to do with each other.
