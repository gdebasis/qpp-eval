341902	Q0	1481925	2	95.629364	bm	A hotspot is an area in the EarthÃ¢Â€Â™s mantle from which hot plumes rise upward, forming volcanoes on the overlying crust. The best example of a hotspot producing a line of volcanic islands is the Hawaiian hotspot. This drawing, from ThurmanÃ¢Â€Â™s Introduction to Oceanography, illustrates how the Hawaiian chain formed as the Pacific tectonic plate moved over the hotspot.

341902	Q0	7582638	4	92.59248	bm	The temperature of the plume causes the crust to melt and form pipes, which can vent magma. Because the tectonic plates move whereas the mantle plume remains in the same place, each volcano becomes dormant after a while and a new volcano is then formed as the plate shifts over the hotspot. The Hawaiian Islands are thought to be formed in such a manner, as well as the Snake River Plain, with the Yellowstone Caldera being the part of the North American plate currently above the hotspot.
341902	Q0	7113053	5	90.53851	bm	1. What causes continental shields to form? folded mountain belts shield volcanoes build-up of oceanic sediments eroded faults 2. The Hawaiian Islands are evidence of what? Answer The crust there has progressively moved over a hotspot. Plate convergence is taking place in the Pacific Ocean. Mantle plumes can move over time. Plate divergence is taking place in the Pacific Ocean. 3. A mantle plume that starts beneath the ocean results in what? Answer a large plateau of flood basalt on the seafloor a divergent plate boundary the development of an oceanic trench a volcanic island arc 4. How do changing ocean basins alter global climate? Answer They have changed global wind patterns. They have altered EarthÃ¢Â€Â™s rotation. They have changed ocean currents.
341902	Q0	84129	6	90.31054	bm	The mixture of molten rock, crystals and dissolved gases from the mantle is called magma. When magma erupts to the Earth's surface, it is called lava. Not all volcanic eruptions happen near the boundaries of tectonic plates. Some eruptions happen in the middle of the plates.These eruptions are caused by mantle streams called plumes. Mantle plumes are formed when hot magma rises beneath the thinner, or weaker, areas of the Earth's crust, creating 'hot spots'. Volcanic islands are formed when mantle plumes form at the bottom of the ocean.ome eruptions happen in the middle of the plates. These eruptions are caused by mantle streams called plumes.

Volcanic islands are formed when mantle plumes form at the bottom of the ocean.
341902	Q0	8191024	7	89.02398	bm	Mantle plumes are areas of hot, upwelling mantle. A hot spot develops above the plume. Magma generated by the hot spot rises through the rigid plates of the lithosphere and produces active volcanoes at the Earth's surface.As oceanic volcanoes move away from the hot spot, they cool and subside, producing older islands, atolls, and seamounts.s continental volcanoes move away from the hot spot, they cool, subside, and become extinct. Hot spots are places within the mantle where rocks melt to generate magma. The presence of a hot spot is inferred by anomalous volcanism (i.e. not at a plate boundary), such as the Hawaiian volcanoes within the Pacific Plate.

It is found in soil, vegetation, water, sewage and the feces of animals and humans. Listeria can cause Listeriosis, a serious but rare illness that in certain cases can lead to brain infection and even death. The elderly, newborns, pregnant women and those who have a weakened immune system are most susceptible to developing Listeriosis. What causes Listeriosis? Listeriosis is caused by eating food contaminated with Listeria bacteria. Listeria can be found in unpasteurized (raw) dairy products, raw vegetables and uncooked meats. Foods can also be contaminated after processing, such as hot dogs, cold cuts or deli meats. Unlike most other harmful bacteria, Listeria will grow on foods stored in a refrigerator. Foods that are contaminated with Listeria look, smell and taste normal. Listeria can be killed by proper cooking procedures.

This process is called 'setting the base advance'.he ignition timing is also dependent on the load of the engine with more load (larger throttle opening and therefore air:fuel ratio) requiring less advance (the mixture burns faster). Also it is dependent on the temperature of the engine with lower temperature allowing for more advance.

Check the timing with the SPOUT out and it should be in the range of 8-14 degrees BTC. Be sure to put the SPOUT back in when you finish.ow your mechanical and electronic problems are fixed, you can set the base idle speed. Setting the base idle speed: First of all, the idle needs to be adjusted to where the speed is at or below 600 RPM with the IAC disconnected.

A scale is also a ruler used in drawing and measuring architectural and engineering plans. Architectural scales units are based on foot/inch dimensions. Floor plan drawings are usually drawn to the scale of 1/4 = 1'-0. For a very large plan, a scale of 1/8 = 1'-0 may be used. When drawing a small plan or a single room, scales of 3/8 = 1'-0, 1/2 = 1'-0, 3/4 = 1'-0, or 1 = 1'-0 may be used to fit the size of your drawing format.

Many people, particularly of African or Asian background, have low levels of lactase, an enzyme that digests lactose. As a result, not all of the lactose can be digested.
20978	Q0	1491984	5	68.33379	bm	Normally, our body produces lactase, which breaks down lactose into two simple sugars, glucose and galactose. These two sugars can then be absorbed into the bloodstream. People whose bodies donÃ¢Â€Â™t make enough lactase canÃ¢Â€Â™t fully digest lactose, causing mild to uncomfortable side effects. Some people have a higher chance of being lactose intolerant, including people of Hispanic, African-American, Asian and Jewish descent. It also affects adults more than children, since the body produces less lactase enzyme as people age. The Dairy Digestion Test can help you determine if you have a dairy sensitivity that may be caused by lactose.

It usually takes about a month or so to make the change, during which time you'll find his baby fur coating your couch, bed and clothes.

The femur is the largest and strongest bone in the body, so it requires a large or high impact force to break this bone. Most femur fractures are the result of a high energy trauma, such as a motor accident, gunshot wound, or jump/fall from a height. However, in an older population a simple fall may cause a femoral fracture due to reduced bone mineral density. A femoral fracture is a very serious injury and needs 3-6 months to heal. Femur fractures can be classified in three types: 1  Femoral head fracture. 2  Femoral shaft fracture.

38197	Q0	5526141	8	66.28665	bm	Femur Shaft Fractures (Broken Thighbone) Your thighbone (femur) is the longest and strongest bone in your body. Because the femur is so strong, it usually takes a lot of force to break it. Car crashes, for example, are the number one cause of femur fractures. The long, straight part of the femur is called the femoral shaft. When there is a break anywhere along this length of bone, it is called a femoral shaft fracture.
