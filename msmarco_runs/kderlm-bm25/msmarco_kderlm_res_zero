Most DNA in an individual genome is found in chromosomes but DNA found outside of the nucleus also serves important biological functions. In prokaryotes, nonviral extrachromosomal DNA is primarily found in plasmids whereas in eukaryotes extrachromosomal DNA is primarily found in organelles.

11130	Q0	5325076	3	70.10123	bm	You will need to take these medicines for the rest of your life. During the first weeks to months after your surgery, your body may try to reject your new kidney. This is called acute rejection and occurs in 25% to 55% of people after transplant.Most of the time, acute rejection can be treated with immunosuppressive medicines.f you have severe chronic kidney disease and choose to have a kidney transplant, you may live longer than if you choose only to treat your kidney disease with dialysis alone. Transplants using a kidney from a first-degree relative, such as your father, mother, brother, or sister, are the most successful.
11130	Q0	8631815	4	62.267906	bm	When you have a kidney transplant, the new kidney is Ã¢Â€ÂœforeignÃ¢Â€Â� to your body. Your bodyÃ¢Â€Â™s immune system fights off or destroys (rejects) anything foreign to keep it running smooth. Because of this, you will take immunosuppressive medications for the rest of your life to prevent your body from rejecting your kidney. Rejection comes in several forms: Hyperacute rejection Ã¢Â€Â“ Because of crossmatching prior to the transplant, this is a very rare form of rejection. It is when the body immediately destroys the transplanted kidney. Acute rejection Ã¢Â€Â“ Usually occurrs in the first few months after transplant, but it can happen at any time after the transplant.
11130	Q0	3985155	5	57.018276	bm	Antibody Mediated Rejection. Clinical presentation. Antibody mediated rejection of the kidney generally occurs hours to days after transplantation (hyperacute rejection), but may be delayed by several weeks if sensitization to donor antigens has occured in the remote past (delayed accelerated acute rejection).
11130	Q0	5586755	6	56.14302	bm	Acute rejection usually occurs in the first few months after transplant, but may occur up to a year after transplant. Up to 20 percent of patients experience at least one rejection episode. Generally, acute rejection can be treated. If treated early, the rejection is usually stopped and good kidney function preserved.
11130	Q0	3985153	7	55.692196	bm	There are three types of rejection: 1  Hyperacute rejection occurs a few minutes after the transplant when the antigens are completely unmatched. 2  Acute rejection may occur any time from the first week after the transplant to 3 months afterward.  Chronic rejection can take place over many years.
11130	Q0	4826768	8	52.140053	bm	Transplant rejection can be classified in three ways, depending on how soon after transplantation it occurs: Acute rejection Ã¢Â€Â“ Ã¢Â€Â˜AcuteÃ¢Â€Â™ means short-term, and refers to an illness with a rapid onset. Acute rejection generally occurs during the first few months after transplantation. Acute rejection can be either T cell mediated or antibody mediated. Hyperacute rejection Ã¢Â€Â“ Occurs within a few minutes after the transplant. This kind of rejection can happen when antibodies against the transplanted organ are already present in the body (a type of antibody-mediated rejection).
11130	Q0	3750685	9	51.75215	bm	Rejection is not a disease; it is the normal reaction of the body to a foreign object. Rejection can be acute or chronic. 1  Acute Rejection-This rejection occurs in the first weeks to months after transplant.
11130	Q0	3292329	10	50.676495	bm	The immune system may attack and reject the transplant kidney, but in a different way than in acute rejection. Chronic rejection is often caused by antibodies in the blood against the transplanted kidney, and investigation of someone with chronic rejection should include a check of the blood for these antibodies.

20978	Q0	404504	1	81.577576	bm	One of the reasons I initially switched to non-dairy milk was because I learned about the prevalence of lactose intolerance: 65 percent of human population has trouble digesting lactose, the sugar found in milk. For people of East Asian descent like me, up to 90 percent of the population is lactose intolerant.
20978	Q0	8760614	2	78.64222	bm	Lactose intolerance is an impaired ability to digest lactose, a sugar found in milk and other dairy products. Lactose is normally broken down by an enzyme called lactase, which is produced by cells in the lining of the small intestine.Congenital lactase deficiency, also called congenital alactasia, is a disorder in which infants are unable to break down lactose in breast milk or formula.pproximately 65 percent of the human population has a reduced ability to digest lactose after infancy. Lactose intolerance in adulthood is most prevalent in people of East Asian descent, affecting more than 90 percent of adults in some of these communities.
20978	Q0	4735453	3	77.794975	bm	Up to 90 percent of South Asians may be lactose intolerant. Lactose intolerance, which is due to the inability to digest milk sugars, is a common disorder caused by a deficiency of the lactase enzyme in the digestive system. Lactose intolerance is three times more common in South Asians than in other populations. 1  Symptoms. 2  Diagnosis.
20978	Q0	6736424	4	71.60176	bm	One relatively common cause of burping and belching is lactose intolerance. Lactose is a type of sugar found in dairy products. Many people, particularly of African or Asian background, have low levels of lactase, an enzyme that digests lactose. As a result, not all of the lactose can be digested.
20978	Q0	1491984	5	68.33379	bm	Normally, our body produces lactase, which breaks down lactose into two simple sugars, glucose and galactose. These two sugars can then be absorbed into the bloodstream. People whose bodies donÃ¢Â€Â™t make enough lactase canÃ¢Â€Â™t fully digest lactose, causing mild to uncomfortable side effects. Some people have a higher chance of being lactose intolerant, including people of Hispanic, African-American, Asian and Jewish descent. It also affects adults more than children, since the body produces less lactase enzyme as people age. The Dairy Digestion Test can help you determine if you have a dairy sensitivity that may be caused by lactose.
20978	Q0	6465780	6	64.01125	bm	People with lactose intolerance are unable to fully digest the sugar (lactose) in milk. As a result, they have diarrhea, gas and bloating after eating or drinking dairy products. The condition, which is also called lactose malabsorption, is usually harmless, but its symptoms can be uncomfortable. A deficiency of lactase Ã¢Â€Â” an enzyme produced in your small intestine Ã¢Â€Â” is usually responsible for lactose intolerance. Many people have low levels of lactase but are able to digest milk products without problems. If you're actually lactose intolerant, though, your lactase deficiency leads to symptoms after you eat dairy foods. Most people with lactose intolerance can manage the condition without having to give up all dairy foods.

20978	Q0	3149045	8	63.15528	bm	Lactose intolerance is a deficiency in the enzyme lactase. Lactase is the enzyme that digests the milk sugar lactose. People with a lactose intolerance typically experience an upset stomach, bloating, gas, and loose stools. These are also common symptoms of a dairy allergy.
20978	Q0	1113327	9	63.03902	bm	What Is Lactose Intolerance? Lactose intolerance is a common problem. It happens when your body does not have enough lactase, which is an enzyme produced in the small intestine. Lactase is necessary to digest lactoseÃ¢Â€Â”the natural sugar found in milk and other dairy products. In the intestines, undigested lactose leads to the buildup of gas. Within 30 minutes to 2 hours after eating dairy products containing lactose, people with lactose intolerance start to develop stomach cramps and diarrhea. These two symptoms must be present for a person to be diagnosed with lactose intolerance.
