341902	Q0	3382270	2	32.082443	bm	The Hawaiian Islands are part of the Emporer Seamounts. This is a chain of underwater (most of it) mountains under the ocean. It is caused by two things. One, there is a plume in the mantle that is continuously welling up from below.Two, the pacific plate rides over this plume.he big island of Hawaii is the youngest of all the Hawaiian islands. Many 1000's of years from now a new island southeast of the big island will form above the ocean's surface. At present it is growing under the oceans surface. Source(s):

The Hawaiian Islands are evidence of what? Answer The crust there has progressively moved over a hotspot. Plate convergence is taking place in the Pacific Ocean. Mantle plumes can move over time. Plate divergence is taking place in the Pacific Ocean. 3. A mantle plume that starts beneath the ocean results in what? Answer a large plateau of flood basalt on the seafloor a divergent plate boundary the development of an oceanic trench a volcanic island arc 4. How do changing ocean basins alter global climate? Answer They have changed global wind patterns. They have altered EarthÃ¢Â€Â™s rotation. They have changed ocean currents.
341902	Q0	8394778	4	31.795105	bm	Island arcs are formed by the subduction of an oceanic plate beneath another oceanic plate. The oceanic plate that is subducted beneath the other plate melts as it is pushed dÃ¢Â€Â¦own into the mantle and creates a source of magma. The magma rises and forms volcanoes which create the islands of the island arc. The Hawaiian islands are formed by a mantle plume which is roughly in the center of the Pacific plate. The plate is moving across the plume and the islands are being formed in a line as the plate moves.
341902	Q0	7582638	5	31.385372	bm	The temperature of the plume causes the crust to melt and form pipes, which can vent magma. Because the tectonic plates move whereas the mantle plume remains in the same place, each volcano becomes dormant after a while and a new volcano is then formed as the plate shifts over the hotspot. The Hawaiian Islands are thought to be formed in such a manner, as well as the Snake River Plain, with the Yellowstone Caldera being the part of the North American plate currently above the hotspot.
341902	Q0	6650019	6	31.268055	bm	The original ideaIn 1963 Wilson suggested that the Hawaiian Islands formed as the Pacific plate moved over continuously upwelling hot mantle. In 1968 Christofferson conjectured that the Emperor-Hawaii elbow records a change in direction of the Pacific plate over a fixed hotspot.awaii, we thought we knew you. The classic Plate Tectonics story for Hawaii now appears to be mistaken. The Pacific plate did not suddenly change directions, and there is no deep, stationary plume. Other explanations fit the evidence better.
341902	Q0	1481925	7	30.929768	bm	A hotspot is an area in the EarthÃ¢Â€Â™s mantle from which hot plumes rise upward, forming volcanoes on the overlying crust.

341902	Q0	6685228	9	28.918222	bm	Whilst most volcanic activity happens at plate margins, there are cases of volcanoes erupting in the middle of plates. The Hawaiian Islands are formed by volcanic activity, despite the nearest plate margin being 3,200 km away. Some geologists have suggested that a 'hot spot' in the mantle, which remains stationary as the Pacific Plate moves over it, explains the existence of the island chain. The hot spot may represent the top of a mantle plume which originated deep down at the outer core - lower mantle boundary.

He had done work on the car and reinstalled the distributor without adjusting the timing. There was some laziness involved or he didn't have his timing light at home. His engine was running hot and that was causing the pinging. Retarding the timing will cause the engine to cool down a bit and stop the pinging. If the timing is too far advanced, the spark itself can cause the pinging. If the engine is too hot or the fuel has too low of an octane rating, pre-ignition can cause the pinging. If there is carbon buildup anywhere in the combustion chamber, the rough ends of the carbon will get red hot and cause the pinging.

379270	Q0	8399811	2	18.189083	bm	The negative ground system acts very much like a set of points and is wired into the ignition circuit very much like points would be. In fact, you can use a standard test lamp to set the static timing in the same manner as you would with a set of points. The positive ground Pertronix system is a very different setup.
379270	Q0	6139466	3	17.982162	bm	Points: Ignition points are a set of electrical contacts that switch the coil on and off at the proper time. The points are opened and closed by the mechanical action of the distributor shaft lobes pushing on them. The points have a tough job, switching up to eight amps of current many times per second at highway speed.

379270	Q0	6349146	9	15.968405	bm	The spark plug fires when the points open. Since the point of ignition timing is to have the spark plug firing at the correct time/point in the cycle, figuring out when the points are supposed to open is important.

379271	Q0	6894844	1	23.38232	bm	by Michael Shiffer. There has been a lot of mail concerning how to set timing with an unknown engine. I think a basic description of timing might help sort out a lot of this. First, you should know that there are two types of timing in an engine: cam timing and ignition timing.
379271	Q0	3681601	2	23.17407	bm	Ignition timing ONLY has to do with when the spark plug lights. The distributor may be driven by the cam gear BUT, the distributor rotates freely and can be rotated in any position to set the timing wherever you want, regardless of whether the cam is advanced, retarded or straight-up.
379271	Q0	6894846	3	22.342848	bm	So, since the cam manufacturers generally provide you with a recommended ignition timing expressed in degrees before top dead center (BTDC) of the compression stroke, it is going to be best to set your timing using a degree wheel.
379271	Q0	2251703	4	22.265331	bm	16.) Over advanced ignition timing can cause the engine to not idle and stall on cold starts. Check the timing with the SPOUT out and it should be in the range of 8-14 degrees BTC. Be sure to put the SPOUT back in when you finish.ow your mechanical and electronic problems are fixed, you can set the base idle speed. Setting the base idle speed: First of all, the idle needs to be adjusted to where the speed is at or below 600 RPM with the IAC disconnected. If you have a wild cam, you may have to raise this figure 100-150 RPM or so.
379271	Q0	6894848	5	22.19736	bm	So, since the cam manufacturers generally provide you with a recommended ignition timing expressed in degrees before top dead center (BTDC) of the compression stroke, it is going to be best to set your timing using a degree wheel. (This is a good time to degree your cam too) On to the dreaded degree wheelÃ¢Â€Â¦.
379271	Q0	5442103	6	22.047255	bm	2. Moving the cam sensor a few degrees does nothing to the ignition timing. If the car runs, (and the 3x trigger on the balancer is mounted correctly by the factory) then your ignition timing will be EXACTLY what's in the spark map of the chip regardless of where the cam sensor is set.3.oving the cam sensor a few degrees does nothing to the ignition timing. If the car runs, (and the 3x trigger on the balancer is mounted correctly by the factory) then your ignition timing will be EXACTLY what's in the spark map of the chip regardless of where the cam sensor is set.
379271	Q0	6894849	7	20.312498	bm	Just because they share the same word of timing doesn't mean they are referring to the same MEANING of what timing is. For some reason a lot of guys think that if their cam is advanced (or retarded) a few degrees that it affects their ignition timing.
379271	Q0	6894851	8	20.312498	bm	Contrary to what a lot of people think, cam timing and ignition timing have nothing to do with each other, anymore than a timing belt and a fan belt have anything to do with each other.

Your kitten most likely isn't complaining and probably enjoys the snuggle, too. Enjoy his soft, fuzzy coat while you can, because soon he'll shed his baby coat for the coarser hair of adulthood.

Starting at around 5 months of age, your kitten may start shedding this soft fur for the thicker, tougher coat he'll carry as an adult. It usually takes about a month or so to make the change, during which time you'll find his baby fur coating your couch, bed and clothes.
