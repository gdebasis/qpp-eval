11130	Q0	8631815	9	15.43162	bm	When you have a kidney transplant, the new kidney is Ã¢Â€ÂœforeignÃ¢Â€Â� to your body. Your bodyÃ¢Â€Â™s immune system fights off or destroys (rejects) anything foreign to keep it running smooth. Because of this, you will take immunosuppressive medications for the rest of your life to prevent your body from rejecting your kidney. Rejection comes in several forms: Hyperacute rejection Ã¢Â€Â“ Because of crossmatching prior to the transplant, this is a very rare form of rejection. It is when the body immediately destroys the transplanted kidney. Acute rejection Ã¢Â€Â“ Usually occurrs in the first few months after transplant, but it can happen at any time after the transplant.
