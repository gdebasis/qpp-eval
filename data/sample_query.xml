<title> foreign minorities, Germany </title>

<desc> Description: 
What language and cultural differences impede the integration 
of foreign minorities in Germany?
</desc>
<narr> Narrative: 
A relevant document will focus on the causes of the lack of
integration in a significant way; that is, the mere mention of
immigration difficulties is not relevant.  Documents that discuss
immigration problems unrelated to Germany are also not relevant.

to understanding and preventing substance abuse and addictions
are relevant.  Documents pertaining to attention deficit disorders
