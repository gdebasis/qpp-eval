A relevant document will contain information on the

involved in more crashes, because that age group is
involved in more crashes.  I would view number of 
fatalities per 100 crashes to be more revealing of 
a vehicle's crashworthiness than the number of

no sign of internal strife, committed suicide.  The only clues
to their self-destruction were notes found near the bodies with
lyrics from Rap songs relating to suicide.  A relevant item 
should include any psychological study, evidence, poll, 
documentation, or psychological opinion that Rap music has a 
deleterious effect upon young people and has led to a discernible
change in personality, life style, crime, alteration of personality
or any other negative effect upon the psyche, mores, and culture
of teenagers.

Evidence that radio waves from radio towers or car phones affect
brain cancer occurrence.

</desc><narr>  
Persons living near radio towers and more recently persons using
car phones have been diagnosed with brain cancer.  The argument 
rages regarding the direct association of one with the other.
The incidence of cancer among the groups cited is considered, by
some, to be higher than that found in the normal population.  A 
relevant document includes any experiment with animals, statistical 
study, articles, news items which report on the incidence of brain 
cancer being higher/lower/same as those persons who live near a 
radio tower and those using car phones as compared to those in the

data from Patent Offices, trade shows, or analysis of a 
competitor's products.

</desc><narr>  
A relevant document will contain specific information on the
theft of trade secrets on new or existing technology.  Relevant
information includes, but is not limited to, espionage in the
highly competitive fashion industry, toy companies, drug firms,
and computer companies.  An apparently legal way of stealing
company secrets is by using the Freedom of Information Act, 
passed by the U.S. Congress in 1966 to help people and the 
press get information for the public good.  The law has often
been used instead by companies for private gain.  Documents
discussing company counterespionage are also considered to be

A look at the roots and prevalence of polygamy 
in the world today.

</desc><narr>  
Polygamy is a form of marriage which permits a
person to have more than one husband or wife.
Polyandry refers to one woman sharing two or 
more husbands at the same time.  Polygyny refers
to one man sharing two or more wives at the 
same time.  Primary focus of the search will be
the prevalence of these practices in the world
today and societal attitudes towards these
practices.  Also relevant would be discussions
of the roots and practical sources of these
customs.  A modern development in this area is
serial polygamy, a phrase coined to label the
practice of men who take a series of wives in
sequence as a solution to practical welfare,
considerations of child care, housing, etc.
Documents discussing serial polygamy will not
be considered relevant.

Relevant documents can also show how much current
fuel sources are available, however, articles

</desc><narr>  
A relevant document will address the questions of how 
and why, and to what degree, bacteria are able to fend 
off the curative effects of antibiotics.  Overuse of 
antibiotics, as well as the increasing use of antibiotics
in promoting the growth of crops and animals whose food
products are meant for human consumption have played roles
in creating a situation where every known bacteria-generated
disease now has versions that resist at least one of the

Relevant documents will argue for or against

export controls.  Since 1993 quality encryption 
software to ensure the secrecy of communications
has been available, but the U.S. Government has 
considered such software to be subject to the same
export controls as munitions, and has sought to 
restrict the export of encryption software unless 
it contains a device which could allow the U.S. to
read the underlying messages.  Business interests

A relevant document would contain reports on what
new steps airports worldwide have taken to better 
scrutinize passengers and their luggage on 
international flights and to step up screening of
all carry-on baggage.  With the increase in 
international terrorism and in the wake of the
TWA Flight 800 disaster, articles on airport 
security relating in particular to additional
steps taken by airports to increase flight safety
would be relevant.  The mere mention of enhanced 
security does not constitute relevance.  Additional
steps refer to something beyond just passenger

Examples of new steps would be additional personnel, 
sophisticated monitoring and screening devices,
