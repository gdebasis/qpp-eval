		<title> foreign minorities, Germany </title> 

<desc>  
What language and cultural differences impede the integration 
of foreign minorities in Germany? </desc>

<narr>  
A relevant document will focus on the causes of the lack of
integration in a significant way; that is, the mere mention of
immigration difficulties is not relevant.  Documents that discuss
immigration problems unrelated to Germany are also not relevant.  </narr>

<title> behavioral genetics </title> 

<desc>  
What is happening in the field of behavioral genetics,
the study of the relative influence of genetic
and environmental factors on an individual's behavior
or personality?
</desc>

<narr>  
Documents describing genetic or environmental factors relating
to understanding and preventing substance abuse and addictions
are relevant.  Documents pertaining to attention deficit disorders
tied in with genetics are also relevant, as are genetic disorders 
affecting hearing or muscles.  The genome project is relevant
when tied in with behavior disorders (i.e., mood disorders,
Alzheimer's disease).
